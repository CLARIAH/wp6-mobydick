# Herman Melville- Moby Dick

This repo contains a single book in different representations:

*   `tei`: [TEI](https://tei-c.org)
    (our source, from the [DBNL](https://www.dbnl.orgdbnl.org))
*   `tf`: [Text-Fabric](https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric)
*   `pd`: [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)

The conversion TEI to TF is done with [programs/tfFromTei.py](programs/tfFromTei.py).

The conversion TF to Pandas is done with [programs/bigTable.py](programs/bigTable.py).

For an example of how to use the Pandas file, see
[programs/pandas.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/CLARIAH/wp6-mobydick/blob/main/programs/pandas.ipynb).

See [docs](docs) for documentation about provenance and encoding.
